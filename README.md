# deepfake
Deepfake technology has emerged as a potent tool for creating synthetic media that convincingly portrays individuals saying or doing things they never did. While these capabilities have various applications, they also raise concerns regarding the potential misuse of manipulated media for misinformation and propaganda. To address this challenge, this project aims to develop a deepfake detection system using MesoNet, a state-of-the-art deep learning model specialized in identifying manipulated facial content.
